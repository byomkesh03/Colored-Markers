# Colored Markers with HTML and CSS

## Overview

In this project, I created a set of colored markers using HTML and CSS. The goal was to learn how to style elements with CSS, apply colors, and manipulate the size and shape of elements. The markers are displayed as circular div elements, each with a unique color.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for the structure of the page.
- **CSS** for the styling of the markers.

## Steps Involved

1. **HTML Structure**: 
   - I started by creating a simple HTML document with a `body` that contains several `div` elements. Each `div` represents a marker.
   - The `div` elements are given a common class for general styling and unique classes to apply individual colors.

2. **CSS Styling**: 
   - The markers are styled with CSS to be circular, using the `border-radius` property.
   - Each marker has a defined width and height, making them evenly sized and round.
   - The background color of each marker is set through individual classes, assigning distinct colors like red, green, blue, and yellow.

## Key Concepts Learned

- **CSS Shapes**: By setting the `border-radius` to 50%, I created circular markers.
- **CSS Layout**: I used properties like `display`, `justify-content`, and `align-items` to center the markers on the page.
- **Color Manipulation**: I learned how to apply different background colors to elements using CSS.

## Conclusion

This project helped me practice working with basic HTML and CSS to create visually interesting designs. It reinforced my understanding of CSS properties such as `border-radius`, `background-color`, and layout techniques for centering content.

By completing this project, I gained valuable experience in styling elements, which will be useful for more complex web development tasks in the future.
